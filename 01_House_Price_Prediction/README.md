#House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This is the first project in my **Machine Learning Mini Project Series**, where I explore foundational ML models using real-world datasets.
In this project, I implemented a **Linear Regression** model to predict house prices based on features like **square footage**, **number of bedrooms**, and **number of bathrooms**.

#Dataset :-
The dataset is taken from Kaggle’s [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

It includes various features like lot size, neighborhood, overall quality, etc. For simplicity, I used:
✤ `GrLivArea` (Ground living area)
✤ `BedroomAbvGr` (Number of bedrooms above ground)
✤ `FullBath` (Number of full bathrooms)
✤ `SalePrice` (Target variable)

#Tech Stack :-
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for EDA)
- Scikit-learn

#What I Did :-
✤ Data cleaning + EDA
✤ Feature selection
✤ Train-test split
✤ Built Linear Regression model
✤ Visualized predictions vs actual values
✤ Evaluated with R² Score

#Results :-
- Predicted house prices with decent accuracy
- Future work: Add Ridge/Lasso, more features, deploy with Flask

#How to Run :- 
1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to this folder
3. Open the notebook in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**
4. Install the libraries:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
